# Titanic Survival Prediction: Full Pipeline Project

This notebook contains the complete solution for the Titanic Survival Prediction practice project. The goal is to build, optimize, and compare a **Random Forest Classifier** (an ensemble model) and a **Logistic Regression** model using scikit-learn pipelines and cross-validation.

## ðŸš€ Objectives

1.  Use scikit-learn to build a model for a classification problem.
2.  Implement a pipeline to combine preprocessing steps with a machine learning model.
3.  Use **Grid Search Cross-Validation** for hyperparameter optimization.
4.  Interpret the results and compare the performances of the classifiers.
