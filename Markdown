# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction: ML Pipeline Comparison

This project uses an end-to-end scikit-learn pipeline to build and compare a **Random Forest Classifier** and a **Logistic Regression Model** for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Implement a robust pipeline with `ColumnTransformer` for clean data preprocessing.
* Optimize model performance using **Grid Search Cross-Validation**.
* Compare the predictive power and interpretability of an ensemble vs. a linear model.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

### Preprocessing Steps:

* **Numerical Features (Age, Fare):** Imputed with the **median** and scaled using `StandardScaler`.
* **Categorical Features (Sex, Class):** Imputed with the **most frequent** value and encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.

### 📈 Key Results

| Model | Model Type | Test Set Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | Ensemble | **83.24%** |
| Logistic Regression (Tuned) | Linear | **82.68%** |

The **Random Forest** performed marginally better, but the feature interpretation revealed significant collinearity, suggesting an area for deeper analysis.
